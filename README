This will read in a Cantera cti file (default if not specified = 'chem.cti') 
and produce a PrIMe formatted thermo polynomial XML file for each species therein

We import a load of classes from ctml_writer which comes with Cantera 
(but is included here in case you can't find it) then add some extra
methods to some of the classes, so that we can do some extra stuff.
